    <p>Hi <%=firstName%>,</p>
    <p>
        I’m Jamal, the owner and founder of Journi, and it’s a pleasure to be speaking with you! Thanks for your
        interest in our services.
    </p>
    <h4>
        A little bit about us.
    </h4>
    <p>
        For starters, we’re Journi, a small Black-owned business that works with fellow small minority-owned businesses
        in Chicago to maximize their revenue and digital presence. I believe that small businesses deserve to have
        production-grade platforms, and Journi is working to lower the barrier to entry. Learn more about us here.

    <h4>
        Here’s what we do…
    </h4>
    <p>
        Here at Journi, we create fully customizable, production-grade apps and websites for small, minority-owned
        businesses along with platform analytics and business metrics. You handle the content. We take care of the code.
        When you work with us, we will create the exact platform you want for <%=orgName%> down to the pixel. To learn
